    "## McCulloch-Pitts Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The first neural network, the McCulloch-Pitts network, was developed in the 1940s. It takes a set of inputs, multiply these inputs by weights, and then outputs either a 0 or 1. If the sum of the products exceed the threshold, then an  output of 1 is returned. Otherwise, the output value is 0. In the case of 2 inputs, this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "output = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rl}\n",
    " 1 &\\mbox{ if $x_{1}w_{1} + x_{2}w_{2} \\geq threshold$} \\\\\n",
    " 0 &\\mbox{ if $x_{1}w_{1} + x_{2}w_{2} < threshold$}\n",
    "       \\end{array} \\right.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can move the threshold to the left side:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{1}w_{1} + x_{2}w_{2} - threshold \\geq 0\\\\$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can define a new term, the bias, as $b=-threshold$. For this entire tutorial, we will use the notation $w_{0}$ to denote the bias instead of $b$. We will also add another $x_{0}$ unit, the bias unit, which always equals 1, to go with the weight. So now the equation becomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{0}w_{0} + x_{1}w_{1} + x_{2}w_{2} \\geq 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we have to define three weights - $w_{0}$, $w_{1}$, $w_{2}$ - and we don't have to worry about the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of network cannot learn--that is, the values of the weights must be determined beforehand and are fixed. Even so, they can be used to compute simple logical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first try to make some logical operators using this simple, two-layer neural network."
