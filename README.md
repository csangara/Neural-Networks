# Neural-Networks

Welcome to the repository of this Neural Networks tutorial!

It is highly recommended that you download the notebook files and run it rather than read through the ones rendered by GitHub. This is because the math equations don't render properly, and also because it is intended to be an interactive tutorial.

The files are numbered, but just for your information, they are supposed to be read in the following order:

1. Introduction

2. Single Layer Neural Networks

3. Multi-layer Neural Networks

4. Implementation: Plotting a Decision Boundary
