    "\n",
    "The first neural network, the McCulloch-Pitts network, was developed in the 1940s. It takes a set of inputs, multiply these inputs by weights, and then outputs either a 0 or 1. If the sum of the products (x1w1 + x2w2) exceed 0, the thrshold, then an  output of 1 is returned. Otherwise, the output value is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in neural networks, we usually add another term, x0w0, called the bias unit. The value of x0 is always one. This will be explained more later, but just know that for this part, you will need to determine three weights (w0, w1, and w2) even though there are only two inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of network cannot learn--that is, the values of the weights must be determined beforehand and are fixed. Even so, they can be used to compute simple logical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first try to make some logical operators using a simple, two layer neural network."
